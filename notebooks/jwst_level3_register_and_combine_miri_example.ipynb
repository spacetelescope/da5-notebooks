    "Stage 3 imaging (Image3, calwebb_image3) processing is intended for combining the calibrated data from multiple exposures (e.g., a dither or mosaic pattern) into a single distortion corrected product. Before being combined, the exposures receive additional corrections for the purpose of astrometric alignment, background matching, and outlier rejection. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Inputs**: The inputs to calwebb_image3 will usually be in the form of an association (ASN) file that lists multiple associated 2D calibrated exposures to be processed and combined into a single product. The individual exposures should be calibrated (\"cal\") from calwebb_image2 processing. It is also possible use a single \"cal\" file as input, in which case only the resample and source_catalog steps will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Outputs**: A resampled/rectified 2D image product with suffix \"i2d\" is created, containing the rectified single exposure or the rectified and combined association of exposures (the direct output of the resample step). A source catalog produced from the \"i2d\" product is saved as an ASCII file in \"ecsv\" format, with a suffix of \"cat\". If the outlier_detection step is applied, a new version of each input calibrated exposure product is created, which contains a DQ array that has been updated to flag pixels detected as outliers. This updated product is known as a CR-flagged product and the file is identified by including the association candidate ID in the original input \"cal\" file name and changing the suffix to \"crf\".\n",
