    "In order to use photutils to do PSF-fitting photometry on simulated JWST PSFs, the first step is to create a grid of fiducial PSFs spanning the instrument/detector of choice. This can be done using the `psf_grid()` method in WebbPSF which will output a (list of or single) photutils `GriddedPSFModel` object(s). Users can then use photutils to apply interpolation to the grid to simulate a spatially dependent PSF anywhere on the instrument, without having to perform a full PSF calculation at each location. This faster approach is critical if you're dealing with potentially tens of thousands of stars scattered across many megapixels of detector real estate.\n",
