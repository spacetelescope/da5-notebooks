    "The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate several ways to perform level 3 processing on a set of input imaging data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 3 imaging processing combines the calibrated data from multiple exposures (e.g., dithered or mosaicked data) into a single distortion-corrected product. This is accomplished using the [**calwebb_image3** pipeine](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/description.html#stage-3-imaging-pipeline-step-flow-calwebb-image3) or its constituent steps. Before being combined, the exposures receive additional corrections/calibrations for the purpose of astrometric alignment, background matching, and outlier rejection. See the [Additional Resources](#addtl_resources) section for links to documentation on the calwebb_image3 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Inputs**: The inputs to **calwebb\\_image3** or its steps will usually be in the form of an [association (ASN) file](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/associations/overview.html) that lists multiple associated 2D calibrated exposures (FITS files) to be processed and combined into a single product. The individual exposures should be calibrated (filenames ending in \"\\_cal.fits\") outputs from the [**calwebb\\_image2** pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/description.html#stage-2-imaging-pipeline-step-flow-calwebb-image2). It is also possible use a single \"*\\_cal.fits\" file as input, in which case only the **resample** and **source\\_catalog** steps of the **calwebb\\_image3** pipeline will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Outputs**: A resampled 2D image product with suffix \"i2d.fits\" is created, containing the rectified (distortion-free) single exposure or the rectified and combined data from the association of exposures. A source catalog produced from the \"i2d\" product is saved as an ASCII file in \"ecsv\" format, with a filename suffix of \"cat\". If the **outlier_detection** step is run, a new version of each input file is created which contains a data quality (DQ) array that has been updated to flag pixels detected as outliers. This updated product is known as a [\"cosmic ray-flagged\" product](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/description.html?highlight=crf#id14) and is saved to a file with a name matching the input filename but with filetype \"crf\"."
